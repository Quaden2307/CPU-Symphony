# CPU Symphony 🎵

## Inspiration
We were curious whether a computer could create its own music using nothing but its internal activity. Since every machine runs different processes at different times, we wondered if streaming CPU data could be transformed into a unique, ever-changing soundtrack—essentially letting each computer "compose" its own song.

## What it does
Our program generates music in real time by analyzing live CPU process data. Different metrics—such as usage spikes, process counts, or priority levels—are mapped to pitch. The result is a constantly evolving piece of music that reflects what the computer is doing at any given moment. Beyond the music generation, we've integrated interactive algorithm visualizations including sorting animations, binary trees, collision simulations, fractals, and Collatz sequences.
